This repository included the codes associated with the Analysis of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) trajectories in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)

## Overview of the project codes and workflow included in the repository
### Stript 01
1) Database selection of variables
2) Time frame formating 
3) Visit selection baseline, 90 days or 180 days
